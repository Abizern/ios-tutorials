title: Getting set up for iOS development
---
*If you are attending an iOS workshop at Codebar, it is very useful if you can download Xcode before you arrive as it is a big download and the internet can become a problem if too many people try and download it at once*

## You will need ##
- An Apple MacBook
- Internet connection

## 1. Downloading Xcode from App Store ##

Download Xcode (it's free) from the Mac [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
This is a fairly large file and will take some time to download.

After you download Xcode, it automatically appears in Launchpad, where you can click the icon for Xcode to launch it.

## 2. The Xcode Development Environment ##
Once you've launched Xcode for the first time, it is useful to become familiar with the environment. Check out Apple's documentation on Xcode's [Workspace Window Overview](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/TheWorkspaceWindow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010215-CH25-SW1)
