# iOS Workshop

This is a repo dedicated to the iOS codebar Workshop. These materials can be used during a normal codebar workshop as long as a coach is there with the skill set.

#### Requirements
* Apple machine - this is because iOS apps can only be built using an Apple machine.
* Xcode - if you plan to go through this is a workshop please make sure this is downloaded beforehand as it can take up to a few hours to install.
